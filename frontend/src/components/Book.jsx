The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and once girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead beforeâ€”and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.</Typography>

                        <Typography variant="body2" display="block" gutterBottom>Some parents may find the book "violent" but it is definitely violence with a purpose. A parent or teacher should always look at the message behind the violence. If it is taught correctly, then your child will come out of the book actually advocating for less violence in current and to stop the glorifying of violence.
      Personally, I teach this to my 7th graders, who every year, read it maturely and analyze the purpose of the violent nature of the book. Sure, if you just read it for face value and don't teach your child or your student the purpose then of course they will read it as just entertainment. Trust your kid's and trust your student's intelligence to be able to understand the deeper meaning behind the novel, which is actually advocating for less violence in the media, not more violence.
